Friends Vs Humanity

Friends vs Humanity is a game that is modelled upon the popular game, Cards vs Humanity with a few key differences. In our version, players answer questions using cards in their hands to questions on the board called question piles.

	Game Initiation
The game is initiated with 5 question piles being placed on a board. Each player is dealt 6 random answer cards 

	Game Mechanics
Each answer card can have a value between 1-4 and when players place the cards onto the question piles, the value of the pile increases according to the card value that was placed. If a player places a value that causes the pile to reach a value of 13, they win the pile outright. If the value goes over 13, the game will randomly allocate the pile to a player.

	More about Question Piles
There is a bank of questions that the questions are chosen from to ensure variety in a game. To select a question pile, click the purple button next to it. To unselect click it again. When a pile becomes inactive, the button turns gray accordingly and cannot be clicked anymore.

	More about Answer Cards
Answer cards for each game comes from the same pile but the value of each card is randomized for each game. This ensures variety in the games. Each player draws a card every turn to replace the card they put into the question pile. Click the blue button to select and click the same button again to unclick. When both a question and answer card is chosen, the current players turn ends.


	How to win
The game ends when a player earns enough piles to gain a majority, (3 piles if there are 2 players and 2 if there are 4 players).
